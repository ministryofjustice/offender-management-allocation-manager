    <h2>a) Make sure POMs have the right ‘roles’ assigned in NOMIS</h2>

    <p>All POMs need to have a new staff role added in NOMIS. This will add them to the list of POMs in the service.</p>

    <p>It can take about an hour for POMs to appear in the service after they have been added to NOMIS.</p>

    <p><b>You should use the most up to date ‘name@justice.gov.uk’ email address.</b></p>
