          Prisoner Offender Managers can now complete early allocation assessments via the prisoner profile pages in the
          Manage POM cases service.
        </p>
        <p>
          An early allocation assessment has 2 important uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>If the case has 18 months or less until release</strong> - a completed assessment will be submitted
            and reviewed for possible early allocation to the community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If the case has 18 months or more until release</strong> - a completed assessment will be added to
            the case record (capturing any notes, concerns or important information).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
