<p class="govuk-body">This Prison Offender Manager no longer has a POM role assigned to them at this prison.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If this POM has changed jobs, or is going to be away from work for a while, you must set their status to inactive.
  This will release their cases so they can be reallocated.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you think this is a mistake</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">If this POM is still managing a caseload you, or your LSA, need to check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the correct role is assigned to the POM in Digital Prison Services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their NOMIS account is active and the correct roles are assigned</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See the steps to do this in the <%= link_to("Guide to getting set up", help_step0_path) %>. You will not be able to manage or reallocate this POMs cases until their status is updated, or their roles are added correctly.</p>
