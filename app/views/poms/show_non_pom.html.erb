<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Check this POM is still active</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">This person is no longer recorded as a POM in NOMIS or Digital Prison Services.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If they are still managing cases</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they have the right role in Digital Prison Services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their NOMIS account is active and the correct roles are assigned to them</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If they have left or will be absent for a while</h2>
<p>
  You must remove them from their cases by changing their status to inactive. Then, allocate their cases to another POM.
